> **"Architecting the trajectory. Excellence in execution."**

### 📂 Phase 0: Exploration & Foundation
I am currently in the acquisition phase—exploring the frontiers of systems, infrastructure, and high-performance software. My goal is to master the underlying logic that allows any technology to scale.

### 🎯 Areas of Interest
- **Systems & Infrastructure:** Understanding how software interacts with hardware.
- **Scaling & Optimization:** Moving from "it works" to "it's efficient."
- **Automation & Devops:** Building the pipelines that power modern tech.
- **Future Tech:** AI agents, distributed systems, and kernel-level logic.

### 🛠️ The Standard
Every project in this profile is a step toward 1.0. I focus on clean code, documented logic, and intentional design.
